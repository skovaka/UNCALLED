A **U**tility for **N**anopore **C**urrent **Al**ignment to **L**arge **E**xpanses of **D**NA

![UNCALLED logo](uncalled_logo_small.png "UNCALLED logo")

A read mapper which rapidly aligns raw nanopore signal to DNA references

Enables software-based targeted sequenceing on Oxford Nanopore (ONT) MinION or GridION [via ReadUntil](https://nanoporetech.com/about-us/news/towards-real-time-targeting-enrichment-or-other-sampling-nanopore-sequencing-devices)

Also includes a simulator which can be used to predict how much enrichment could be achieved on a given reference using raw signal data from previous nanopore runs.

## Installation

### Native


```
> pip3 install git+https://github.com/skovaka/UNCALLED.git --user
```

OR

```
> git clone --recursive https://github.com/skovaka/UNCALLED.git
> cd UNCALLED
> python3 setup.py install --user
```

Requires python >= 3.6, read-until == 3.0.0, pybind11 >= 2.5.0, and GCC >= 4.8.1 (all except GCC are automatically downloaded and installed)

Other dependencies are included via submodules, so be sure to clone with `git --recursive`

We recommend running on a Linux machine. UNCALLED has been successfully installed and run on Mac computers, but real-time ReadUntil has not been tested on a Mac. Installing UNCALLED has not been attempted on Windows.

### Docker

To build a Docker container image for this project,

``` bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/skovaka/UNCALLED.git
cd UNCALLED/docker
docker build -t uncalled:latest .
```

This will build an ubuntu image for you with a copy of this repo in `/opt/UNCALLED`. To start an interactive session, run

``` bash
docker run --rm -it uncalled bash
```

To add your own data, you can mount it as a volume somewhere in the container:

``` bash
docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/host/data:/data uncalled bash
```

## Indexing

**Example:**


```
> uncalled index -o E.coli E.coli.fasta
```
**Positional arguments:**

- `fasta-file` reference genome(s) or other target sequences in the FASTA format

**Optional arguments:**

- `-o/--bwa_prefix` output index prefix (default: same as input fasta)

Note that UNCALLED uses the [BWA](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) FM Index to encode the reference, and this command will use a previously built BWA index if all the required files exist with the specified prefix. Otherwise, a new BWA index will be automatically built. 

**We recommend applying repeat masking your reference if it contains eukaryotic sequences.** See [masking](masking/) for more details.

## Fast5 Mapping

**Example:**

```
> uncalled map -t 16 E.coli fast5_list.txt > uncalled_out.paf
Loading fast5s

```

**Positional arguments:**

- `bwa-prefix` the BWA reference index prefix generated by `uncalled map`
- `fast5-files`  Reads to be mapped. Can be a directory which will be recursively searched for all files with the ".fast5" extension, a text file containing one fast5 filename per line, or a comma-separated list of fast5 file names.

**Optional arguments:**

- `-l/--read-list` text file containing a list of read IDs. Only these reads will be mapped if specified        
- `-n/--read-count` maximum number of reads to map
 - `-t/--threads` number of threads to use for mapping (default: 1)
- `-e/--max-events-proc` number of events to attempt mapping before giving up on a read (default 30,000). Note that there are approximately two events per nucleotide on average.


See [example/](example/) for a simple read and reference example.

```

We recommend that you try mapping fast5s via `uncalled map` before real-time enrichment, as runtime issues could occur if UNCALLED is not installed properly.

The command can generally be run at any time before or during a sequencing run, although an error may occur if UNCALLED is run before any sequencing run has been started in the current MinKNOW session. If this is happens you should start UNCALLED after the run begins, ideally during the first mux scan. If you want to change the chunk size you must run the command *before* starting the run (see below). 

**Positional arguments:**
- `bwa-prefix` the BWA reference index prefix generated by `uncalled map`

**Required arguments:**
- `--enrich` will *keep* reads that map to the reference if included OR
- `--deplete` will *eject* reads that map to the reference if included
Exactly one of `--deplete` or `--enrich` must be specified

**Optional Arguments:**

- `-c/--max-chunks` number of chunks to attempt mapping before giving up on a read (default: 10).
- `--chunk-size` size of chunks in seconds (default: 1). Note: this is a new feature and may not work as intended (see below)
- `-t/--threads` number of threads to use for mapping (default: 1)
- `--port` MinION device port.
- `--even` will only eject reads from even channels if included
- `--odd` will only eject reads from odd channels if included
- `--duration` expected duration of sequencing run in hours (default: 72)


### Altering Chunk Size

The ReadUntil API receives signal is "chunks", which by default are one second's worth of signal. This can be changed using the `--chunk-size` parameter. Note that `--max-chunks-proc` should also be changed to compensate for changes to chunk sizes. *If the chunk size is changed, you must start running UNCALLED before sequencing begins.* UNCALLED is unable to change the chunk size mid-seqencing-run. In general reducing the chunk size should improve enrichment, although [previous work](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.926956) has found that the API becomes unreliable with chunks sizes less than 0.4 seconds. We have not thoroughly tested this feature, and recommend using the default 1 second chunk size for most cases. In the future this default size may be reduced.

## Simulator

**Example:**

```
> uncalled sim E.coli.fasta /path/to/control/fast5s --ctl-seqsum /path/to/control/sequencing_summary.txt --unc-seqsum /path/to/uncalled/sequencing_summary.txt --unc-paf /path/to/uncalled/uncalled_out.paf -t 16 --enrich -c 3 --sim-speed 0.25 > uncalled_out.paf 2> uncalled_err.txt

> sim_scripts/est_genome_yield.py -u uncalled_out.paf --enrich -x E.coli -m mm2.paf -s sequencing_summary.txt --sim-speed 0.25

unc_on_bp       150.678033
unc_total_bp    6094.559395
cnt_on_bp       33.145022
cnt_total_bp    8271.651331
```

The simulator simulates a real-time run using data from two real runs: one control run and one UNCALLED run. Reads are simulated from the control run, and the pattern of channel activity of modeled after the control run. The simulator outputs a PAF file similar to the real-time mode, which can be interperted using scripts found in [sim_scripts/](sim_scripts/).

Example files which can be used as template UNCALLED sequencing summary and PAF files for the simulator can be found [here](http://labshare.cshl.edu/shares/schatzlab/www-data/UNCALLED/simulator_files/). The control reads/sequencing summary can be from any sequencing run of your sample of interest, and it does not have to match the sample used in the provided examples.

The simulator can take up a large amount of memory (> 100Gb), and loading the fast5 reads can take quite a long time. To reduce the time/memory requirements you could truncate your control sequencing summary and only the loads present in the summary will be loaded, although this may reduce the accuracy of the simulation. Also, unfortunately the fast5 loading portion of the simulator cannot be exited via a keyboard interrupt and must be hard-killed. I will work on fixing this in future versions.

Arguments:

- `bwa-prefix` the prefix of the index to align to. Should be a BWA index that `uncalled index` was run on
- `control-fast5-files` path to the directory where control run fast5 files are stored, or a text file containing the path to one control fast5 per line
- `--ctl-seqsum` sequencing summary of the control run. Read IDs must match the control fast5 files
- `--unc-seqsum` sequencing summary of the UNCALLED run
- `--unc-paf` PAF file output by UNCALLED from the UNCALLED run
- `--sim-speed` scaling factor of simulation duration in the range (0.0, 1.0], where smaller values are faster. Setting below 0.125 may decrease accuracy.
- `-t/--threads` number of threads to use for mapping (default: 1)
- `-c/--max-chunks-proc` number of chunks to attempt mapping before giving up on a read (default: 10). Note that for the simulator, altering this changes how many chunks is loaded from each each, changing the memory requirements.
- `--enrich` will *keep* reads that map to the reference if included
- `--deplete` will *eject* reads that map to the reference if included
- `--even` will only eject reads from even channels if included
- `--odd` will only eject reads from odd channels if included

Exactly one of `--deplete` or `--enrich` must be specified

## Output Format

UNCALLED outputs to stdout in a format similar to [PAF](https://github.com/lh3/miniasm/blob/master/PAF.md). Unmapped reads are output with reference-location-dependent fields replaced with \*s. Lines that begin with "#" are comments that useful for debugging.

Query coordinates, residue matches, and block lengths are estimated assuming 450bp sequenced per second. This estimate can be significantly off depending on the sequencing run. UNCALLED attempts to map a read as early as possible, so the "query sequence length" and "query end" fields correspond to the leftmost position where UNCALLED was able to confidently map the read. In many cases this may only be 450bp or 900bp into the read, even if the read is many times longer than this. This differs from aligners such as [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2), which attempt to map the full length of the read.

The "query sequence length" field currently does not correspond to the actual read length, rather an estimate of the number of bases that UNCALLED attempted to align. In most cases this will be equal to "query end". This may be changed to better reflect the full read length in future versions.

Both modes include the following custom attributes in each PAF entry:

- `mt`: **map time**. Time in milliseconds it took to map the read.
- `ch`: **channel**. MinION channel that the read came from.
- `st`: **start sample**. Global _sequencing_ start time of the read (in signal samples, 4000 samples/sec).

`uncalled realtime` also includes the following attributes:

- `ej`: **ejected**. Time that the eject signal was sent, in milliseconds since last chunk was received.
- `kp`: **kept**. Time that UNCALLED decided to keep the read, in milliseconds since last chunk was received.
- `en`: **ended**. Time that UNCALLED determined the read ended, in milliseconds since last chunk was received.
- `mx`: **mux scan**. Time that the read _would have_ been ejected, had it not have occured within a mux scan.
- `wt`: **wait time**. Time in milliseconds that the read was queued but was not actively being mapped, either due to thread delays or waiting for new chunks.

### pafstats

We have included a functionality called `uncalled pafstats` which computes speed statistics from a PAF file output by UNCALLED. Accuracy statistics can also be included if provided a ground truth PAF file, for example based on [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2 alignments of basecalled reads. There is also an option to output the original UNCALLED PAF annotated with comparisons to the ground truth.

**Example:**
```
> uncalled pafstats -r minimap2_alns.paf -n 5000 uncalled_out.paf
Summary: 5000 reads, 4373 mapped (89.46%)

Comparing to reference PAF
     P     N
T  88.74  6.80
F   0.60  3.74
NA: 0.12

Speed            Mean    Median
BP per sec:   4878.24   4540.50
BP mapped:     636.29    362.00
MS to map:     140.99     89.96
```

Positional arguments
- `infile` PAF file output by UNCALLED

Optional arguments
- `-n/--max-reads` maximum number of reads to parse
- `-r/--ref-paf` ground-truth alignments (from minimap2) to compute TP/TN/FP/FN rates
- `-a/--annotate` if used with `-r`, will output PAF with "rf:" tag indicating TP, TN, FP, or FN

Accuracy statistics:
- TP: true positive - percent infile reads that overlap reference read locations
- FP: false positive - percent infile reads that do not overlap reference read locations
- TN: true negative - percent of reads which were not aligned in reference or infile
- FN: false negative - percent of reads which were aligned in the reference but not in the infile
- NA: not aligned/not applicable - percent of reads aligned in infile but not in reference. Could be considered a false positive, but the truth is unknown.

## Practical Considerations

For ReadUntil sequencing, the first decision to make is whether to perform **enrichment** or **depletion** (`--enrich` or `--deplete`). 
In enrichment mode, UNCALLED will eject a read if it *does not* map to the reference, meaning your target should be the reference. 
In depletion mode, UNCALLED will eject a read if it *does* map to the reference, meaning your target should be everything except your reference.

Note that enrichment necessitates a quick decision as to whether or not a read maps, since you want to eject a read as fast as possible. Usually ~95% of reads can be mapped within three seconds for highly non-repetitive references, so setting `-c/--max-chunks-proc` to `3` generally works well for enrichment. The default value of `10` works well for depletion. Note these values assume `--chunk-size` is set to the default 1 second.

UNCALLED currently does not support large (> ~1Gbp) or highly repetitive references. 
The speed and mapping rate both progressively drop as references become larger and more repetitive. 
Bacterial genomes or small collections of divergent bacterial genomes typically work well. 
Small segments of eukaryotic genomes can also be used, however the presence of any repetitve elements will harm the performance. 
Collections of highly similar genomes wil not work well, as conserved sequences introduce repeats.
See [masking](masking/) for repeat masking scripts and guidelines.

ReadUntil works best with longer reads. Maximize your read lengths for best results. You may also need to perform a nuclease flush and reloading to achieve the highest yield of on-target bases.

UNCALLED currently only supports reads sequenced with r9.4.1/r9.4 chemistry.
